# Vagrant directory
This is a sample of a config and the .jakhu directory for tubs

The .jakhu dir includes:
* A folder for each tubs `start.sh`, `build.sh`, logs and tmp
* A copy of the config for each tub (generated by jakhu.js)

The root of this dir (this repo/vagrant) contains a sample web-app configuration.
